# python_metadata_remover
python script to remove all EXIF metadata from image batch

To use this script, save it as clean_image_metadata.py and run it from the command line like this:

python clean_image_metadata.py /path/to/input/folder /path/to/output/folder

or

python clean_image_metadata.py /path/to/image/file.jpg /path/to/output/folder

If you don't specify an output folder, the cleaned files will be saved in a folder with the same name as the input folder or file, with the suffix "_cleaned" added.
